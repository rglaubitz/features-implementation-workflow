# ISSUE: Research Team Recency Validation Flaw

**Date Identified:** 2025-10-06
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Research documented technologies 6-9 months out of date
**Status:** DOCUMENTED (Fix deferred for workflow v2)

---

## Problem Statement

The research team (17 agents, Waves 1-4) documented cutting-edge technologies but relied on outdated information (January 2025 knowledge cutoff), missing 6-9 months of critical releases.

### What Was Missed

**Major Releases (April - October 2025):**
- **GPT-5** (August 2025) - Current SOTA, 80% better reasoning than GPT-4o
- **GPT-5-Codex** (September 2025) - Can think 7+ hours on coding tasks
- **GPT-4.1 series** (April 2025) - mini, nano variants (83% cheaper, 50% faster)
- **GPT-5 Instant** - Low-latency variant
- **text-embedding-3-large** - Better embeddings than documented 3-small
- **Graphiti 0.21.0** - Documented 0.20.4 as "stable", 0.21.0 as "RC"
- **Qdrant 1.15.1** - Documented 1.12+, missed 3 versions

### Impact

- Research documented pre-April 2025 technology stack
- ADRs based on outdated capabilities and benchmarks
- Missing evaluation of latest SOTA options
- Actual codebase (`requirements.txt`) ahead of research documentation
- Wasted ~8 hours of research + significant token costs

## Root Cause Analysis

### Layer 1: Knowledge Cutoff Blindness
- Primary LLM (Claude) has January 2025 knowledge cutoff
- Agents used LLM knowledge as primary source without validation
- No systematic check for "What was released since cutoff?"

### Layer 2: No Time-Awareness Protocol
- Research-first principles focus on SOURCE QUALITY (Tier 1/2/3)
- Zero focus on SOURCE RECENCY
- Authority ≠ Currency
- Official docs can be cached/outdated for months

### Layer 3: Tool Misuse
- WebSearch available but not used systematically for recency
- No protocol for: "Search '[tech] releases 2025'"
- Sporadic searches vs systematic validation

### Layer 4: Missing Agent Role
- No "Latest Tech Scout" exists in agent lineup
- `documentation-hunter` finds docs (any version)
- `github-examples-hunter` finds examples (any age)
- Nobody's explicit job: "What's THE LATEST RIGHT NOW?"

### Layer 5: Workflow Design Flaw
- No "Phase 0: Latest Version Check" before research
- Waves 1-4 assume you know what's current
- CIO validates quality, not currency
- No recency gate in approval process

---

## Proposed Solution (Multi-Layered Defense)

### Fix #1: Create `latest-tech-scout` Agent ⭐ PRIMARY

**Mission:** Systematically find latest versions for EVERY technology

**Protocol:**
1. Check TODAY's date vs knowledge cutoff → identify gap
2. WebFetch official changelog/releases
3. Systematic searches:
   - "[tech] latest version [current month year]"
   - "[tech] releases since [cutoff date]"
   - "[tech] changelog [year]"
4. Build month-by-month release timeline
5. Output: `research/version-timelines/[tech].md` + `TECH-RADAR.md`

**Deploy:** Phase 0 (BEFORE Wave 1)

---

### Fix #2: Add Recency Validation to All Agents

Add mandatory protocol to all 17 research agents:

```markdown
## RECENCY VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

Before documenting ANY version:
1. Check current date from context
2. Acknowledge knowledge cutoff: January 2025
3. If gap > 1 month: MUST validate with WebSearch
4. Required format:
   **Version:** [X.Y.Z]
   **Released:** [Month Year]
   **Verified:** [Date you checked]
   **Source:** [URL]
```

---

### Fix #3: Add Recency Dimension to Source Quality

**Current:** Tier 1/2/3 (Authority only)

**New:** Add Freshness Score

```
Recency Scores:
- R1 (Fresh): <3 months old
- R2 (Current): 3-6 months old
- R3 (Recent): 6-12 months old
- R4 (Stale): 12-24 months old → MUST VALIDATE
- R5 (Outdated): >24 months old → HIGH RISK

Example: GPT-5 docs (Aug 2025) = Tier 1 + R1 = GOLD
Example: HNSW paper (2016) = Tier 3 + R5 = VALIDATE

CIO Gate: 80%+ sources must be R1-R3
```

---

### Fix #4: Create Living TECH-RADAR.md

Auto-generated dashboard showing:
- What's new since knowledge cutoff
- Version gaps (research vs latest)
- Recency health score
- Monthly refresh schedule

---

### Fix #5: Update Workflow

**Add Phase 0:**
```
PHASE 0: LATEST TECH SCAN (NEW)
  Agent: latest-tech-scout
  Output: version-timelines/*.md, TECH-RADAR.md
  Gate: Must complete before Wave 1
  Quality: All techs have timelines, verified <30 days
```

**Update Waves 1-4:**
- All agents document ONLY latest versions from TECH-RADAR.md
- All docs require "Verified: [date]" timestamps
- No docs >90 days old without re-verification

---

### Fix #6: Update CIO Review

Add new section: **Currency & Recency Validation**

Checklist:
- [ ] TECH-RADAR.md exists and current (<30 days)
- [ ] All versions verified within 30 days
- [ ] 80%+ sources are R1-R3 recency
- [ ] Jan 2025 → current timeline documented

Auto-REJECT if:
- ❌ TECH-RADAR.md missing
- ❌ Recency health <50%
- ❌ Critical tech missing version timeline

---

### Fix #7: Monthly Refresh Protocol

**1st of every month:**
1. Re-run latest-tech-scout
2. Regenerate TECH-RADAR.md
3. Flag research >90 days old
4. Create monthly update report
5. Alert if recency health <70%

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Emergency Fix (Stop the Bleeding)
- Day 1-2: Create latest-tech-scout agent
- Day 3-4: Run full tech scan, generate TECH-RADAR.md
- Day 5: Damage assessment, prioritize fixes

### Week 2: Fix Current Research
- Day 6-8: Update high-priority docs (OpenAI, Graphiti, Qdrant)
- Day 9-10: Update all 5 ADRs with corrected versions

### Week 3: Fix the System
- Day 11-12: Update all 17 agents with Recency Protocol
- Day 13: Update research-manager (add Phase 0)
- Day 14: Update CIO review checklist

### Ongoing: Stay Current
- Monthly: Re-run tech scout, update TECH-RADAR
- Quarterly: Full research refresh

## Immediate Actions Taken (2025-10-06)

1. ✅ Documented issue (this file)
2. ⏳ Update current research to Oct 2025 versions (in progress)
3. ⏳ Create corrections status report
4. ⏸️ **System fix deferred** - will implement in workflow v2

---

## Prevention Measures

**This will NEVER happen again because:**
1. Phase 0 catches gaps upfront (latest-tech-scout)
2. Every agent validates recency (mandatory protocol)
3. CIO rejects stale research (<70% recency health)
4. Monthly refresh keeps everything current
5. TECH-RADAR.md provides visibility

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Authority ≠ Currency** - Official docs can be months stale
2. **Knowledge cutoffs are dangerous** - 6-9 month gap is massive in AI
3. **Systematic > Ad-hoc** - Need protocols, not sporadic searches
4. **Validation matters** - Trust but verify, especially for versions
5. **Real world diverges fast** - Codebase was ahead of research

**Priority:** HIGH (prevent future waste of time/tokens)
