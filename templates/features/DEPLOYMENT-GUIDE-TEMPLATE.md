## Production Rollout Strategy

See [deployment/PRODUCTION-ROLLOUT.md](./deployment/PRODUCTION-ROLLOUT.md) for detailed rollout guide.

### Rollout Stages

```
Stage 1: Baseline (Day 0)       → Existing system only
Stage 2: Feature flags (Day 0)  → Enable flags at 0%
Stage 3: Canary (Day 1-3)       → 5% rollout
Stage 4: Gradual (Day 4-14)     → 25% → 50% → 100%
Stage 5: Cleanup (Day 15+)      → Remove old code
```

### Stage 1: Baseline Metrics (Day 0)

**Goal:** Establish performance baseline

```bash
# Collect baseline metrics for 24 hours
# Monitor:
# - Latency (P50, P90, P99)
# - Error rate
# - Throughput (requests/sec)
# - Resource usage (CPU, Memory)
```

**Success criteria:**
- System stable for 24 hours
- All metrics within normal range

### Stage 2: Enable Feature Flags (Day 0)

**Goal:** Deploy code with feature disabled

```bash
# Enable feature flag at 0%
[command to enable at 0%]

# Verify flag state
[command to check flag]

# Expected: Feature enabled but affecting 0% of users
```

**Success criteria:**
- Code deployed successfully
- Feature flag at 0%
- No impact on existing traffic

### Stage 3: Canary Rollout (Day 1-3)

**Goal:** Test with 5% of traffic

```bash
# Day 1: Enable for 5%
[command to set 5%]

# Monitor for 72 hours
# Watch for:
# - Error rate increase
# - Latency regression
# - User complaints
```

**Success criteria:**
- Error rate < [threshold]
- Latency increase < [threshold]
- No critical issues for 72 hours

### Stage 4: Gradual Rollout (Day 4-14)

**Goal:** Increase to 100% safely

```bash
# Day 4: 25%
[command to set 25%]
# Monitor for 3-4 days

# Day 8: 50%
[command to set 50%]
# Monitor for 3-4 days

# Day 14: 100%
[command to set 100%]
# Monitor for 1 week
```

**Success criteria at each stage:**
- All metrics stable or improved
- No increase in errors
- Positive user feedback

### Stage 5: Cleanup (Day 15+)

**Goal:** Remove feature flags and old code

```bash
# After 2 weeks at 100%, cleanup
# - Remove feature flag checks
# - Delete old code paths
# - Update documentation
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Dashboards

**Grafana:** http://localhost:3000

Dashboards to monitor:
- [Feature Name] Overview
- Component Performance
- Database Health
- Error Rates

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Alert | Dashboard |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Error Rate | > [value] | Critical | [Dashboard link] |
| Latency P99 | > [value] | Warning | [Dashboard link] |
| CPU Usage | > [value] | Warning | [Dashboard link] |
| Memory Usage | > [value] | Warning | [Dashboard link] |

### Prometheus Queries

```promql
# Error rate
rate([metric_name]_errors_total[5m])

# Latency P99
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate([metric_name]_latency_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Throughput
rate([metric_name]_requests_total[1m])
```

### Alert Configuration

```yaml
# alerts.yml
groups:
  - name: [feature_name]_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate([metric_name]_errors_total[5m]) > [threshold]
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}"
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Instant Rollback (< 1 minute)

```bash
# Rollback via feature flag
[command to set 0%]

# Verify rollback
[command to check status]

# Expected: Feature disabled for all users
```

### Full Rollback (< 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Disable feature flag
[command to disable]

# 2. Revert deployment
git checkout [previous-commit]
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Verify services
docker-compose ps

# 4. Monitor logs
docker logs -f [service-name]
```

### Rollback Decision Tree

```
Issue detected
    ↓
Is error rate > [critical threshold]?
    ├─ YES → Instant rollback (feature flag)
    └─ NO
        ↓
    Is latency > [critical threshold]?
        ├─ YES → Instant rollback
        └─ NO → Gradual rollback (reduce percentage)
```
