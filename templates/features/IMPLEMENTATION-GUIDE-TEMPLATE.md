## Pre-Flight Verification

### 1. Check [Dependency Name]

```bash
# Check version
[command to check version]

# Requirement: [Version requirement] for [feature support]
# If incorrect version, update configuration
```

**Why:** [Explanation of why this matters]

### 2. Check [Another Dependency]

```bash
# Check status
[command to check]

# Requirement: [Requirement description]
```

**Recommended Config:**
```yaml
[Configuration example]
```

### 3. Add [Infrastructure Component]

```yaml
# Add to docker-compose.yml or similar

[Infrastructure configuration]
```

---

## Dependency Installation

### Update requirements.txt

```bash
cd [project-directory]

# Add to requirements.txt:
cat >> requirements.txt << 'EOF'

# [Feature Name] Dependencies
[dependency-1]==[version]  # [Purpose]
[dependency-2]==[version]  # [Purpose]
[dependency-3]==[version]  # [Purpose]
EOF

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import [module]; print([module].__version__)"
# Expected: [version]
```

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Day 1-2: Quick Wins

#### 1.1 [Quick Win Name]

**File:** `[file path]`

```python
# Implementation code
```

**Why this matters:** [Explanation]

#### 1.2 [Another Quick Win]

[Repeat structure]

### Day 3-5: [Major Component]

**File:** `[file path]` (NEW)

```python
"""[Module description]"""

[Full implementation code]
```

**Integration:**

```python
# File: [integration point file]

# How to integrate this component
```

**Testing:**

```python
# File: tests/unit/test_[component].py

import pytest
from [module] import [Component]

@pytest.fixture
def component():
    return [Component]()

def test_[functionality](component):
    """Test [what is being tested]."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Day 5-7: [Another Component]

[Repeat structure]

### Day 8-10: [Final Component]

[Repeat structure]

---

## Phase 2: [Phase Name] (Week 3-4)

[Same structure as Phase 1, with components specific to this phase]

---

## Phase 3: [Phase Name] (Week 5-6)

[Same structure as Phase 1, with components specific to this phase]

---

## Phase 4: [Phase Name] (Week 7-8)

[Same structure as Phase 1, with components specific to this phase]

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**File:** `tests/unit/test_[component].py` (NEW)

```python
import pytest
from [module] import [Component]

@pytest.fixture
def [fixture_name]():
    return [Component]()

def test_[functionality]([fixture_name]):
    """Test [description]."""
    # Test implementation
    assert [condition]

def test_[edge_case]([fixture_name]):
    """Test [edge case description]."""
    # Test implementation
    assert [condition]
```

### Integration Tests

**File:** `tests/integration/test_[feature]_integration.py` (NEW)

```python
import pytest
from [module] import [System]

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_[integration_scenario]():
    """Test [integration scenario description]."""
    # Setup
    system = [System]()

    # Execute
    result = await system.[method]()

    # Assert
    assert [condition]
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_[component].py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=[module] --cov-report=html
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback

If critical issues arise during deployment:

```bash
# 1. Disable feature via feature flag
[command to disable]

# 2. Revert to previous version
docker-compose down
git checkout <previous-commit>
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Monitor logs
docker logs -f [service-name]
```

### Gradual Rollback

```bash
# Reduce rollout percentage
[command to reduce percentage]

# Monitor for [duration]
# If stable, continue reduction

[command to full rollback]
```

---
