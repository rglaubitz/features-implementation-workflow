## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles

1. **Incremental Rollout**
   - Deploy alongside existing system
   - A/B test with [X]% traffic initially
   - Gradually increase based on metrics

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Keep existing endpoints working
   - Feature flags for new capabilities
   - Gradual migration path

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all new components
   - Integration tests for interactions
   - Performance benchmarks
   - A/B testing in production

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Log all decisions
   - Track latency per component
   - Monitor accuracy metrics
   - Alert on degradations

### Code Organization

```
src/[project]/[component]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [file1].py               # Existing
â”œâ”€â”€ [file2].py               # NEW: [Description]
â”œâ”€â”€ [file3].py               # NEW: [Description]
â”œâ”€â”€ [file4].py               # UPDATED: [Changes]
â””â”€â”€ [file5].py               # Existing
```
