## Workflow Integration

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Create in planned/
mkdir -p upgrades/planned/[feature-name]
cp workflow/templates/features/README-TEMPLATE.md upgrades/planned/[feature-name]/README.md

# 2. Fill in initial scope
# Edit upgrades/planned/[feature-name]/README.md

# 3. Get stakeholder approval

# 4. Move to active/ when ready to start
mv upgrades/planned/[feature-name] upgrades/active/[feature-name]

# 5. Execute Phase 1 (RDF)
/rdf [feature-name]
# OR manually research and create IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
```

### During Implementation

```bash
# Feature stays in active/ throughout implementation

# Phase 1: RDF
# - Create research docs in ../../research/
# - Create IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
# - Create IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md

# Phases 2-5: Implementation
# - Implement Phase X
# - Generate tests
# - Create examples
# - Update docs
# - Context compact
# - Move to Phase X+1

# Phase 6: Deployment Manual
# - Create deployment/TESTING.md
# - Create deployment/PRODUCTION-ROLLOUT.md
# - Create deployment/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
# - Create deployment/examples/

# Phase 7: Deploy
# - Follow deployment guide
# - Monitor production
```

### Completing a Feature

```bash
# 1. Verify completion criteria
# ‚òë All phases complete
# ‚òë Deployed to production
# ‚òë Stable for 2+ weeks
# ‚òë Documentation 100% complete

# 2. Move to completed/
mv upgrades/active/[feature-name] upgrades/completed/[feature-name]

# 3. Update completed/README.md with entry

# 4. Commit
git add upgrades/
git commit -m "feat: Complete [feature-name] upgrade"
git push
```

## Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

1. **Start in planned/** - Don't skip initial planning
2. **Move to active/ when starting** - Clear status
3. **Keep active/ organized** - One directory per feature
4. **Complete all phases** - Don't skip deployment manual
5. **Archive to completed/** - Preserve for reference
6. **Update status regularly** - Keep README current

### DON'T ‚ùå

1. **Skip planned/ phase** - Always scope first
2. **Start multiple active features** - Focus on one
3. **Leave features in active/ forever** - Complete or cancel
4. **Delete completed/** - Archive, don't delete
5. **Skip documentation** - Always complete docs
6. **Forget to update status** - Keep tracking current
