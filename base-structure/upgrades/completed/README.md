## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Preserve everything** - Keep all implementation artifacts
2. **Document lessons learned** - Write honest post-mortems
3. **Capture metrics** - Record actual performance data
4. **Note surprises** - Document unexpected outcomes
5. **Compare estimates** - Track estimate accuracy
6. **Keep examples working** - Maintain code samples
7. **Update regularly** - Add long-term observations
8. **Reference in new work** - Link to completed examples

### DON'T ❌

1. **Delete completed work** - Archive, don't remove
2. **Skip post-deployment notes** - Always document learnings
3. **Move too early** - Ensure 2+ weeks stability
4. **Forget metrics** - Capture final performance data
5. **Sanitize failures** - Document what didn't work
6. **Leave incomplete docs** - Finish all documentation
7. **Skip verification** - Confirm all criteria met
8. **Lose context** - Preserve decision rationale

---

## Learning from Completed Work

### Pattern Recognition

**Identify successful patterns:**

```bash
# Find features with similar characteristics
grep -r "Timeline: 6 weeks" completed/*/POST-DEPLOYMENT-NOTES.md

# Find high-impact features
grep -r "Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐" completed/*/POST-DEPLOYMENT-NOTES.md

# Find features with specific tech
grep -r "Neo4j" completed/*/IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
```

### Estimate Calibration

**Improve future estimates:**

```markdown
## Historical Timeline Accuracy

| Feature | Est. | Actual | Accuracy | Pattern |
|---------|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Feature 1 | 8w | 8w | 100% | Research-heavy accurate |
| Feature 2 | 6w | 7w | 86% | Underestimated testing |
| Feature 3 | 4w | 5w | 80% | Integration complexity |

**Lessons:**
- Research-heavy estimates tend to be accurate
- Testing phase often takes longer than estimated
- Integration work is consistently underestimated
```

### Risk Identification

**Learn from challenges:**

```markdown
## Common Risks from Past Work

**Timeline Risks:**
- Integration testing takes 1.5x longer than estimated (80% of projects)
- API changes mid-implementation (30% of projects)

**Technical Risks:**
- Database migration complexity (40% of projects)
- Performance issues not caught in testing (20% of projects)

**Mitigation:**
- Add 50% buffer to integration testing
- Lock API versions at start
- Include migration rehearsals in timeline
- Production-scale performance testing
```

---

## Maintenance

### Keeping Completed Work Current

**Periodic updates:**

**Quarterly Review:**
- Update long-term metrics
- Note any issues discovered
- Document maintenance work
- Update troubleshooting guides

**Annual Review:**
- Assess if feature still relevant
- Note technology evolution
- Update recommendations
- Archive if deprecated

### Deprecation

**When feature becomes obsolete:**

```bash
# 1. Document deprecation
cat >> completed/[feature-name]/DEPRECATION-NOTES.md << 'EOF'
# Deprecation Notes

**Deprecated:** [Date]
**Reason:** [Why feature was retired]
**Replaced By:** [New feature if applicable]

## Historical Context

[Why this feature was built, its impact while active]

## Lessons Learned

[What we learned that applies to replacement]
EOF

# 2. Keep in completed/ for historical reference
# DO NOT delete - preserve institutional knowledge

# 3. Update README to note deprecation
