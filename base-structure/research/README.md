## Research Quality Standards

### Documentation Requirements

**All research documents must include:**

1. **Source Citations**
   ```markdown
   **Source:** [Document Name](URL)
   **Accessed:** 2025-10-08
   **Tier:** 1 (Official Documentation)
   **Verified:** ✅ Current as of Oct 2025
   ```

2. **Version Numbers**
   ```markdown
   **Technology:** semantic-router
   **Version:** 0.1.11
   **Released:** October 2025
   **Verified via:** GitHub API
   ```

3. **Breaking Changes**
   ```markdown
   **Breaking Changes:**
   - v0.2.0: API restructure (not yet released)
   - v0.1.0 → 0.1.11: Backward compatible
   ```

4. **Comparison Tables**
   ```markdown
   | Feature | Option A | Option B | Recommended |
   |---------|----------|----------|-------------|
   | [Feature] | [Details] | [Details] | Option A (Why) |
   ```

### Validation Requirements

**Before adding research:**
- ✅ Source is Tier 1-3 (Tier 4-5 only as supplements)
- ✅ Documentation is current or explicitly verified as valid
- ✅ Breaking changes are documented
- ✅ Versions are verified via GitHub API or package registry
- ✅ Code examples are tested or from verified repos

## Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Research Collection

```bash
# Use Exa AI for web research
/research [topic] [framework]

# Use GitHub API for version verification
# Check package registries for latest versions
```

**Deliverables:**
- 3+ sources per research question
- All Tier 1-2 sources
- Version numbers verified

### Phase 2: Documentation

**Create research documents:**

```markdown
# [Topic] - [Framework Name]

**Status:** Complete
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Version Researched:** [Version]

## Overview
[2-3 paragraph overview]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1
- Finding 2
- Finding 3

## Sources
1. [[Source 1](URL)] - Tier 1 - Official docs
2. [[Source 2](URL)] - Tier 2 - 2.8k stars
```

### Phase 2.5: Documentation Chunking (NEW)

**When research documents exceed 500 lines, apply chunking workflow:**

See **[DOCUMENTATION-CHUNKING-WORKFLOW.md](DOCUMENTATION-CHUNKING-WORKFLOW.md)** for complete guide.

**Quick Overview:**
1. Analyze structure → Identify 4-6 natural topic boundaries
2. Create chunks → ~150 lines each, focused and standalone
3. Add cross-references → Link related chunks
4. Create INDEX.md → Decision tree navigation
5. Create WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md → Usage during development
6. Archive originals → Preserve history
7. Validate → Ensure no information lost

**Benefits:**
- 80% research utilization (vs 20% without chunking)
- Focused context → No hallucinations
- 10-15 min read time (vs 60+ min for full file)
- Research actually gets used during implementation

**Success Case:** Apex UI/UX Enhancements (4 files → 16 chunks + navigation system)

### Phase 3: Architecture Decisions

**Document decisions in ADRs:**

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** [Date]

## Context
[What problem are we solving?]

## Decision
[What did we decide?]

## Research Support
**Tier 1 Sources:**
- [Source 1]

**Chunked Documentation:** (if applicable)
- `chunk-name.md` (lines 45-120)

**Benchmarks:**
- [Performance data]

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- [Benefit 1]

**Negative:**
- [Tradeoff 1]
```

## Organization Patterns

### Per-Framework Documentation

```
research/documentation/neo4j/
├── README.md                    # Neo4j overview
├── vector-index-guide.md        # Vector search feature
├── cypher-best-practices.md     # Query optimization
└── graph-algorithms.md          # Algorithm library
```

### Cross-Framework Topics

```
research/documentation/query-routing/
├── README.md                    # Query routing overview
├── semantic-router.md           # Semantic classification
├── query-rewriting-rag.md       # Query rewriting patterns
└── adaptive-routing-learning.md # Adaptive weight learning
```

### Verified Examples

```
research/examples/multi-database-rag/
├── README.md                    # Example overview
├── lettria-case-study.md        # Production example (1.5k+ stars)
└── implementation-notes.md      # Key insights
```

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Always cite sources** - Every claim needs a source
2. **Verify versions** - Check GitHub API or package registry
3. **Document breaking changes** - Critical for upgrades
4. **Create comparison tables** - Help decision-making
5. **Use Tier 1-2 sources** - Official docs and verified code
6. **Update research regularly** - Technology evolves

### DON'T ❌

1. **Use blog posts as primary sources** - Supplement only
2. **Trust version numbers without verification** - Always verify
3. **Skip breaking changes** - Critical information
4. **Make assumptions** - Research, don't guess
5. **Use outdated documentation** - Verify currency
6. **Skip citations** - Always include sources

---

## Integration with Implementation

**Research documents support:**

1. **Improvement Plans**
   - Research links in IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
   - Decisions backed by research
   - Alternatives documented

2. **Implementation Guides**
   - Reference research docs for approach
   - Use verified code examples
   - Follow researched best practices

3. **Architecture Decision Records**
   - Cite research in ADRs
   - Document alternatives considered
   - Show data-driven decisions

## Getting Started

### For a New Topic

1. **Identify research questions:**
   - What are the latest versions?
   - What are the alternatives?
   - What are the best practices?
   - What are the breaking changes?

2. **Collect sources:**
   - Use Exa AI for official docs
   - Use GitHub API for version verification
   - Search for verified code examples (1.5k+ stars)

3. **Document findings:**
   - Create markdown files in appropriate subdirectory
   - Include all citations
   - Document versions and breaking changes

4. **Create ADR if needed:**
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Cite research support
   - List alternatives considered

---

## Maintenance

**Research should be updated:**
- Before starting implementation of related features
- When new versions are released
- When breaking changes are announced
- When new alternatives emerge
- Quarterly review of all documentation

---

**Research-first development ensures better decisions, fewer rewrites, and production-ready code.**
