      Medium  : 31 failures (31.0%)
      Hard    : 21 failures (42.0%)

   Example Failures:

   1. [EASY] show me all dependencies between microservice-auth and other services
      Expected: graph | Actual: semantic
      Rationale: Explicit 'dependencies between' graph terminology

   2. [EASY] trace the connection path from user login to database access
      Expected: graph | Actual: temporal
      Rationale: Explicit 'connection path' and 'trace' graph signals

   3. [EASY] what systems depend on the authentication service
      Expected: graph | Actual: semantic
      Rationale: Clear 'depend on' dependency relationship

   4. [EASY] show the network topology for our cloud infrastructure
      Expected: graph | Actual: semantic
      Rationale: Direct 'network topology' graph terminology

   5. [EASY] which databases are coupled to the user authentication module
      Expected: graph | Actual: semantic
      Rationale: Clear 'coupled to' dependency relationship

🎯 Success Criteria Evaluation
   Easy tier ≥95%:     ❌ (actual: 86.9%)
   Medium tier ≥85%:   ❌ (actual: 69.0%)
   Hard tier ≥70%:     ❌ (actual: 58.0%)
